# PhysicsSim

## Purpose
I've written this project to get practice in using modern OpenGL through writing shaders and directly communicating with the GPU. Drawing inspiration from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE&list=LL&index=14&t=1648s&ab_channel=SebastianLague)

## What is it?
This project is meant to simulate the interactions between particles, (in the case water) through the use of molecular force modeling. As with most simulations, many
artistic liberties have been taken for visual appeal, but it is *based on a true story* as they say. There are many different configurable simulation variables like:
1) Force of gravity & toggleable gravity
2) Force between particles
3) Distance between particles
4) Area of effect of particles

## Dependencies
- [FreeGlut](https://github.com/FreeGLUTProject/freeglut)
- [Glew](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew)

## Environment
I've been developing and testing exclusively on Linux so your mileage may vary.
 - Debian Linux 12 (X11)
 - compiled with version CXX
